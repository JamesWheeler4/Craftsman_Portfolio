## Blue Sky Farm Projects
While working at *Blue Sky Farm*, I was taught the basics of welding and took off from there. Over time, more complex projects given to me along with complicated problems to solve. The projects shown here are in chronological order. 

If you would like to skip to final project at *Blue Sky Farm*, scroll down to **Project 7**

### Project 1: Organizer
To get the feel of the new skill and make sense of my new work space, I created a wall mounted organizer for all the loose ends kept on the welding table.

### Project 2: Spool
Next came a more complicated project. I was tasked with recreating a dripline unwinding spool. After discussing what was required with my supervisor, I drew up a couple different configurations. The plan was to eventually have a trailer to mount the spools on and to have them designed to be operated by one person while being mounted ~10 feet apart. The limitation of a single operator played a bit role in the break I designed. 

I started with creating strong bases to mount the hub on. At this point I made sure to square the mounting plate to the base of frame.

To safely hold the dripline, I had 4 foot disks cut with the proper hub mounting layout cut from the middle. Having the hub precut saved a lot of head ache. The brake I created was designed to balance with very slight pressure maintained on the disk. As well as a long lever to magnify force applied to the brake if needed.

To finish the spools, I found the largest pipe in the scrap pile and used the torch to cut 3 foot lengths. Making sure to cut drainage ports and perfectly center the pipe section relative to the disks.

### Project 3: Sweeper Cage
Having confidence in my abilities, my supervisor gave me the task of creating a protective cage for the hazelnut sweeper. We looked at designs online and none of them fit the feel that he wanted. I desided to make a mock up wire frame to test the rough structure and mounting points as well as design. The entire front-end articulates so finding solid mounting points while maintaining clearances was essential.
